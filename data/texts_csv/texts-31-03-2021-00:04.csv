PC gamer OMEN 30L. Repousse les limites de l'humanit√© par le gaming. #Windows10
Great advice I found in r/poor: ‚ÄúBuy even 10 dollars in Bitcoin at a time if that's all you can spare. That's how I started. Today, the first 10 dollars I've put in just crossed the million-dollar mark. That took only a decade of holding a value I would've spent anyway.‚Äù
